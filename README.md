# Fringe-Scheduler
### A way to schedule your 10 days of Fringe with as much shows as possible (or at least humanly possible).

# Motivation

FRINGE IS AWESOME. It is tiring, exhausting, but fun and exciting. And as a Fringe enthusiast for the past 6 years, I have the biggest problem every single year: **How do I optimize my week so I can watch as much as possible (or the shows I must prioritize)?**

Fringe always has over 100 shows (most indoor, but a lot are buskers/street performers) so watching all shows within the week will be practically impossible. But I aim to make a program that can target a person's preferences. For example, if you hate one-man shows, WHY subject yourself to that pain? Or you're willing to forgo improv as it is a yearly thing hosted by improv theatre companies throughout the year. I want to make a program that can make your Fringe (or film festival experience) as efficient and crammed full of the things YOU want while considering your personal circumstances.

For example, I aim to account for travel distance (like why is the Roxy Theatre 40 MINUTES AWAY from the Fringe ground?), travel methods (bus, walking, cycling, cars). Finally, people also work throughout the week so I also want to account for breaks, volunteer shifts, parties, work shifts, and any events where you're not available.

This is just a passion project to fix a problem I've been trying to solve by brute force for the past 6 years. And now I'm gonna make a program to do it for me!
